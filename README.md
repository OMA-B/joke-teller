# joke-teller

As the name implies, this is a small project of a robot that tells jokes by;

~fetching joke text from a remote API...

~passing the text to a remote server (VoiceRSS) to be converted to voice...

~and then returning an audio script that is then played to the user.

I've arranged the files and codes in such a way that you wouldn't find difficulty navigating through and understanding...

But if get muzzled at any point, you can always reach out to me on any of my social media platform(links' on my profile)...

I hope you like it, and if find it helpful/useful, kindly give a star and leave a follow. Thank you.

Would love to receive your feedback as well, so kindly reach out.
